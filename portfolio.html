                <h3>From Original Song to Acoustic Version</h3>
                <p>
                    For this project, I was asked to transform an original song<br>
                    into an acoustic version. <br>
                    Here you can listen to the original song <br>
                    and the work I did.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this case, I was asked to record on electric guitar <br>
                    what the artist had already laid out <br>
                    in a MIDI track but needed a real guitar. <br>
                    Here you can listen to the artist's song with the<br>
                    MIDI track and the work I did.

                <h3>From MIDI Guitar to Real Guitar</h3>
                <p>
                    Once again, I worked on transforming a MIDI guitar track <br>
                    into a real performance. <br>
                    The goal was to stick to what the artist laid out in their <br>
                    MIDI track while also adding a more human touch <br>
                    to the guitar track.
                    <br>
                    Here you can listen to the original song with the MIDI track<br>
                    and compare it to the final version<br>
                    featuring my work.
                </p>
