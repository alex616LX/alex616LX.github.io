    <h2 class="hello">Hello! I'm Alex from LexSound.<br>LexSound started as a YouTube channel where I upload instrumental guitar covers of genres<br> like K-pop, electronic music, pop, and more. I usually replicate the chord progressions of each song<br> and play the vocals with the guitar.<br>
        Now, LexSound has evolved into a project where I offer my services <br>to record electric or acoustic guitars for other artists according to their needs!<br>
        This is LexSound Audio Works, and this is my portfolio. <br>keep scrolling, and I'll tell you more!</h2>

        <h3>From Original Song to Acoustic Version</h3>
        <p>For this project, I was asked to transform an original song<br> into an acoustic version. <br>Here you can listen to the original song <br>and the work I did.</p>
        <p>Original Song:</p>
        <audio controls controlsList="nodownload">
            <source src="audio/original.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
            Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>
        <p>The acoustic version i did:</p>
        <audio controls controlsList="nodownload">
            <source src="audio/acustica.mp3" type="audio/mp3">

        <h3>From MIDI Track to Real Guitar</h3>
        <p>In this case, I was asked to record on electric guitar <br>what the artist had already laid out <br>in a MIDI track but needed a real guitar. <br>Here you can listen to the artist's song with the<br> MIDI track and the work I did.</p>
        <p>Song with the MIDI track</p>

        <p>Song with the real guitar track i did:</p>

        <h3>From MIDI Guitar to Real Guitar</h3>
        <p>Once again, I worked on transforming a MIDI guitar track <br> into a real performance. <br>The goal was to stick to what the artist laid out in their <br>MIDI track while also adding a more human touch <br>to the guitar track.
    <br> Here you can listen to the original song with the MIDI track<br> and compare it to the final version<br> featuring my work.</p>       <p>Original song with MIDI guitar</p>
